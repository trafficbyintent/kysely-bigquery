# Secrets for testing GitHub Actions locally with act
# Copy this file to .secrets and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit .secrets to version control!

# This file is used by act to simulate GitHub repository secrets when testing
# workflows locally.

# Required for npm publishing (get from npmjs.com)
NPM_TOKEN=your-npm-automation-token-here

# For act testing, you may need to provide BigQuery secrets that GitHub Actions expects
# These should match what's configured in your GitHub repository secrets
#
# Option 1: Read from your .serviceAccount.json file and paste here:
# BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS=<paste entire service account JSON>
#
# Option 2: Use environment variables from .env (recommended):
# The test script can be modified to pass .env values as secrets to act
#
# Example:
# BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account",...}
# BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
# BIGQUERY_DATASET=your_test_dataset

# Note: GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by act, no need to set it here
